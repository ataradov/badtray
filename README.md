# Badtray

This is a very simple self-hosted server to receive files from remote systems.
This works similar to Bintray (RIP) and primarily designed to deploy CI build
artifacts.

This server does not host any files, but it generates static index.html files
that can be served using any web-server.

Note that this was created in one evening and probably not too secure, use
at your own risk. You've been warned.
